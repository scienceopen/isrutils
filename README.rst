AMISR raw data utilities
========================
Utilities for working with Incoherent Scatter Radar data, especially from Poker Flat AMISR.

We work with the complex IQ voltage samples, the lowest level data available from the radar (after integration of several pulses, perhaps on the 0.1 milliscond time scale).

Coming soon, simultaneous plots with high speed multi-camera synchronized video.
